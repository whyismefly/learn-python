• object—Two meanings: the most basic kind of thing, and any instance of some thing.
• instance—What you get when you tell Python to create a class.
• def—How you defi ne a function inside a class.
• self—Inside the functions in a class, self is a variable for the instance/object being accessed.
• inheritance—The concept that one class can inherit traits from another class, much like
you and your parents.
• composition—The concept that a class can be composed of other classes as parts, much
like how a car has wheels.
• attribute—A property classes have that are from composition and are usually variables.
• is- a—A phrase to say that something inherits from another, as in a “salmon” is- a “fi sh.”
• has- a—A phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait, as in “a
salmon has- a mouth.”
